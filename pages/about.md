description: a few things about me

---

Hi, I'm Jason, I've been coding since I was 11, (1982) and
professionally since 1987, with a few gaps here and there to persue
other careers in music and design during the 90's.

I've never been a particularly prolific blogger, but there are
fragments of my code all over the internet, in Lisp, C#, C, C++,
Objective C, Perl, Python, Ruby, and of course, JavaScript and several
languages which are now dead, (I was a junior COBOL dev in 1987.)

I'm a fairly enthusiastic user of Emacs, (since about 1989, and much
more so in the last 5 years) and I started keeping an Emacs
specific blog, [EmacsFodder](http://emacsfodder.github.com) last
year. 

I wanted a place to put more general coding related stuff, hence
[CodeFodder](http://codefodder.ruhoh.com), which is what you're
reading now, although oddly, you seem to be spending time reading 4 or
5 paragraphs of cruft, hey, you're bored, it happens.

I also produce music and art, for my own enjoyment, and I like to
think you'll enjoy it too.
